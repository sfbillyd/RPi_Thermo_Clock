This project is a fork based mostly off of Simon Monk's work I found on the Adafruit Learning site.
(http://learn.adafruit.com/large-pi-based-thermometer-and-clock/overview)

It uses a one-wire temperature sensor and displays the time and temperature on a 7 segment LEDBackpack. 
It also sends the temperature to a thingspeak channel. 
I adapted the code for that off of a tutorial the xively.com site (https://xively.com/dev/tutorials/pi) and tweaked it based on reading several different sources.

The Adafruit Repo can be found here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code

The Adafruit language related to sharing their code is here:
"Adafruit's Raspberry-Pi Python Code Library
Here is a growing collection of libraries and example python scripts for controlling a variety of Adafruit electronics with a Raspberry Pi
