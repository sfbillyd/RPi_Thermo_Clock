This project is a fork based mostly off of Simon Monk's work I found on the Adafruit Learning site.
It uses a one-wire temperature sensor and displays the time and temperature on a 7 segment LEDBackpack. It also sends the temperature to a thingspeak channel.

The Adafruit Repo can be found here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code

The Adafruit language related to sharing their code is here:
"Adafruit's Raspberry-Pi Python Code Library
Here is a growing collection of libraries and example python scripts for controlling a variety of Adafruit electronics with a Raspberry Pi
In progress!
